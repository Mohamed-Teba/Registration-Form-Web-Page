## 🖥️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/registration-form.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:

   ```bash
   cd registration-form
   ```

3. **Open** `index.html`:

   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) by double-clicking it or using a local server.
   - For a better experience, use a local development server like Live Server in VS Code.
   - **Note**: Update the background image path in `style.css` (`body { background: url("...") }`) to a valid image URL or local file path, as the current path (`C:/Users/WDT/...`) is specific to the original environment.

4. **Explore the App**:

   - Navigate through Home, About, and Contact Me links.
   - Toggle between Login and Sign Up forms using the buttons or links.
   - Test registration and login with sample credentials (data is stored in local storage).
   - Observe the responsive menu on mobile devices or by resizing the browser.

## 📱 Responsiveness

The web app is fully responsive, with tailored layouts for:

- **Mobile (≤540px)**: Full-width form, single-column layout, hidden navigation buttons, and toggleable menu.
- **Tablet (≤786px)**: Collapsible navigation with a burger menu, centered form layout.
- **Desktop (&gt;786px)**: Fixed navigation bar with visible buttons, centered form with smooth animations.

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Connect the forms to a backend service (e.g., Node.js, Firebase) for persistent user data storage.
- **Password Strength Validation**: Add checks for password complexity (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
- **Forgot Password Functionality**: Implement a password reset feature with email verification.
- **Enhanced Security**: Hash passwords before storing them in local storage or a backend database.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
- **Custom Alerts**: Replace `alert()` with styled modal dialogs for better UX.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Add a slideshow or dynamic background image changer.
